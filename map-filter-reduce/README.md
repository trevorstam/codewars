### Problem Domain:
- Make double function return an array --> input numbers
- In array each value must be doubled
- Only use .map method to return array of same length

### Algorithm
- write function that takes in array
- use .map method on array
- multiply each value by 2
- store step 2 and 3 in variable
- return variable

### Problem Domain
- Create function that takes in a list as param of non-negative numbers and strings
- Filter out strings
- return new list

### Algorithm
- Create function that takes in list as param
- use .filter method
- in filter method only select elements in array with typeof 'number'
- return result

### Problem Domain
- Calculate average of numbers in array

### Algorithm
- Write function that takes in array of numbers
- Create variable in which you chain .reduce method onto array
- divide variable by length of array
- return variable
