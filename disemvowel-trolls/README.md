## Code Wars Challenge: Disemvowel Trolls
### Partners: Trevor Stam  & Brai Frauen
https://www.codewars.com/kata/disemvowel-trolls

## Problem Domain
- Our task is to write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
- For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
- Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

## Algorithm
- Create function that passes in a string as a parameter
- Make a regex that omits vowels a, e, i, o, u but NOT y with the .replace method
- Make sure the regex is case insensitive
- Return the string
